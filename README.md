# Scheduler
It was made to practice and show off my skills with JavaScript
## Description

- My motivation for this project was to understand how to use Jquery and get more comfortable with coding over all.    
- I built this project, because I wanted to work on for loops and local storage as well. Jquery and Javascript have been a struggle, but I do feel like I'm starting to understand it.
- This project gives me the ability to use the local storage to save information into a daily planner or scheduler. 
- I'm starting to really understand that no matter what you are mostly likely going to be struggling the whole time in this bootcamp, but to keep working on yourself and even though I messed up really badly on my last assignment and felt overwhelmed. I asked for more help this time and worked with my classmates.

Honestly, trying to understand jquery is difficult,because it is another thing to learn ontop of everything else, but I know that this struggle is a good thing.
